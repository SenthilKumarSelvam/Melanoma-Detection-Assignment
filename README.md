# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection
> Develop a custom CNN in TensorFlow to detect melanoma, a deadly skin cancer, using a dataset of 2,357 images from ISIC. The model aims to assist dermatologists by automating diagnosis and reducing manual effort.

## General Information
- The dataset, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), consists of 2,357 images of both malignant and benign oncological conditions. Images are categorized based on the ISIC classification system. While the dataset is balanced across most classes, melanomas and moles have a slightly higher representation.
- The objective of this assignment is to build a CNN-based model capable of accurately detecting melanoma. Melanoma is a severe form of cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. A reliable model that evaluates images and alerts dermatologists about the presence of melanoma can significantly reduce the manual effort required for diagnosis.

## Data understanding
- The dataset comprises a total of 2,357 images, representing malignant and benign oncological conditions. These images were obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), a trusted source for dermatological image data..
- Key details about the dataset:
-   Source: International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
-   Content: Images of malignant and benign skin conditions.
-   Classification: All images were categorized based on ISIC's classification system.
-   Distribution: The dataset is balanced, with subsets containing an equal number of images.
